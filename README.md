# Art Scenerio Generator
A generator that picks from the preloaded scenerios and puts two of my characters in the interaction to give the user an idea of what to draw. It uses tkinter to load an application window to run the file. 

# What I Learned
* How to use the internet to find solutions to code I don't know yet.
  * All I knew was that I wanted an application window instead of just text in the command prompt. A collaborator then showed me how to search for exactly what I need.
* Python loops

# Run it

```
python3 generator.py
```
